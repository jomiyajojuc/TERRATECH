Making for a beautiful home decor element, Sanseveria or snake plant is a very popular house plant for its beautiful snake-like shaded leaves. Commonly referred to as mother-in-law’s tongue, is a resilient succulent that can grow anywhere between 6 inches to several feet. It helps to filter air. What’s unique about this particular plant is that it’s one of the few plants that can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen at night, which makes this plant ideal for room décor and also regulates healthy airflow.

>> Snake plant care tips
If you plan to have a snake plant in your home, here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
Don’t overwater. Too much water is this plant’s weakness. Place a snake plant in a well-drained pot to avoid overwatering, as it can cause rotting. Only water the soil when it’s completely dry.

Indirect sunlight is best. Partial sun works best for snake plants. Though, it can still grow in darker corners or in brighter window areas. If completely shaded, the plant can dull and the leaves may become a bit floppy.
