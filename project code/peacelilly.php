<h1>Peace lilly</h1>
<p>>> Overview

A flowering house plant, peace lily is known to bring good luck and health other than its air-purifying properties. Native primarily to tropical rainforests of America, the peace lily plant is a vibrant and graceful perennial that adds life to any space. The standard peace lily can grow to 24-40 inches and deluxe plants can grow to 32-50 inches.
 Very well cared for plants may bloom again in the fall as well. Blooms last for two months or more and after blooms fade, a period of non-blooming follows. Peace lilies manage just fine in darker quarters such as offices, bedrooms, and hospital rooms. Combine its ease of care with its aide in helping the air clean.
It can remove benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, ammonia, xylene, toluene and several other known pollutants from air. It is a low maintenance plant that blooms profusely during the summer season. 
>>Peace Lily Care Tips

Light: Peace lilies prefer light partial shade, and can tolerate fluorescent lights. In fact, some have been known to thrive in rooms with no windows at all. Yellowing leaves indicate that the light is too strong, and brown leaves or streaks indicate scorching from direct sunlight. Consider placing the plant six to eight feet away from a north- or west-facing window.
 
Water: If you’re wondering how often to water a peace lily, one tip is to wait for the plant to droop slightly before watering. One of the great advantages in caring for the peace lily is the fact that it sags a bit when it needs water, essentially telling you when it’s thirsty. In general, water at least once a week and keep the soil moist. Throughout the summer growing season, spritz the leaves with soft or distilled water. Water your plant less often in winter.
Even if you forgot to water for a while and find your plant completely depleted with fronds flat over the pot edge, water and spritz right away. You may be surprised at how quickly the peace lily revives.
Peace lilies can be sensitive to chlorine. If your municipal water system is heavily chlorinated, fill a container with water and then allow it to stand overnight so the chlorine can percolate out before pouring into the peace lily.
 
Temperatures: The peace lily makes a great house plant because it thrives in the indoor temperatures most people enjoy. It prefers a temperature range of 65-85°F and humid climates. Peace lilies cannot withstand cold drafts or temperatures below 45°F. Best to keep them indoors most of the year and displayed away from any heating or cooling home appliances.
 
Toxicity: They are poisonous to both cats and dogs alike because they contain calcium oxalate. Peace lilies should be kept away from animals and small children. Being educated about the risks will help you avoid any accidents. 
 
Pests and Problems: Compared to other house plants, the peace lily is relatively immune to insects and diseases. While they can get spider mites, aphids and mealy bugs, owners generally keep these pests under control with regular wiping of the leaves. If pests invade, spray plant with insecticidal soap.
Brown leaf tips can stem from everything from over-watering, over-fertilizing and lack of humidity. Learn to follow your plant’s signals. If leaves are browning at the bottom of the plant, it could just mean these older leaves can’t compete with the more rapidly growing younger leaves.
The peace lily wins the “easy” label for four reasons. First, it sags when it needs water and revives quickly after a long drink. Second, it thrives in low light conditions. Third, the peace lily is very resilient. An insect infestation or a few missed waterings may make it wilt and pale, but it bounces back quickly. Finally, with sufficient care and occasional wiping of its leaves, the peace lily doesn’t seem to be the insect magnet that roses and other house plants are.
