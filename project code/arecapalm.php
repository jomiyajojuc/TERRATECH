<h1>Areca Palm
</h1>
<p>Overview Overview
Areca palm (Chrysalidocarpus lutescens) is one of the most widely used palms for bright interiors. It features feathery, arching fronds, each with up to 100 leaflets. These big, bold plants command attention.They add 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm.) of growth per year until they reach a mature height of 6 or 7 feet (1.8 or 2.1 m.). Areca palm is one of the few palms that can tolerate trimming without serious harm, making it possible to keep mature plants indoors for their full lifespan of up to 10 years.

They need bright, indirect light from a south- or west-facing window. The leaves turn yellowish-green in direct sunlight. It is also called the Living Room Plant. It absorbs poisonous gases such as Pharmaldehyde, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from the air and gives clean oxygen. To generate clean oxygen in the house put 4 Areca Palm (up to the height of shoulder) in the living room. You need to clean its leaves everyday. It needs to be kept in the sun once in three to four months.

>> Areca palm plant care tips
Fertilize areca palm plants with a time-release fertilizer in spring. This gives the plant most of the nutrients it needs for the entire season. The fronds benefit from a micronutrient spray in summer. You can use a liquid houseplant fertilizer that contains micronutrients for this purpose. Make sure the product is labeled as safe for foliar feedings, and dilute it according to the label instructions. Do not feed areca palm plants in fall and winter.
 Areca palm houseplants need repotting every two to three years. The plant likes a tight container, and crowded roots help limit the size of the plant. The main reasons for repotting is to replace the aged potting soil and remove fertilizer salt deposits that build up in the soil and on the sides of the pot. Use a palm potting soil or a general purpose mix amended with a handful of clean builder’s sand. 
Take care to plant the palm in the new pot at the same depth as in the old pot. Planting it too deeply can cause serious injury. The roots are brittle, so don’t attempt to spread them out. After filling in around the roots with soil, press down with your hands to make sure the soil is tightly packed. Eliminate air pockets by flooding the pot with water and pressing down again. Add additional soil if necessary.
