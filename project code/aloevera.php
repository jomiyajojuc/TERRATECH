<h1>Aloe vera</h1>
<p>Overview 

A perennial succulent, aloe vera is known for being good for your skin. It is often known as the wonder plant as it has many medical benefits and is a known herb. Aloe vera is used in million forms in Indian households- from skin treatment packs to even cooking. It is greatly effective in cleaning benzene and formaldehyde from the air, making it an air-purifying boon! 
Aloe Vera Plant is best known to remove toxins from the air like aldehydes and benzene. Unlike most plants, it releases oxygen at night as well and is well suited for a household environment. They grow slowly and have thick pointed leaves with white transparent gel. It is a medicinal plant used for different treatments. It mostly flourishes in a sunny atmosphere and overwatering can damage its roots. It is also known for releasing oxygen at night. 


>> Types of Aloe vera
Tiger or Partridge-Breasted Aloe (Aloe variegata)
 
Aloe variegat is a small succulent that grows up to a foot tall with leaves as long as six inches. This aloe plant’s leaves have a green and white striped texture to them, hence the “tiger” nickname. In comparison to the tiger plant’s leaf size, the flower tends to be the largest part of the partridge-breasted aloe, reaching up to 18 inches.
 
 
Lace Aloe (Aloe aristata)
Lace aloe, like tiger aloe, is a stemless plant with dark green leaves that reach up to four inches long. During fall months, lace aloe can develop terminal panicles, which reach 20 inches in height, and a few inch-long orange flowers. Their petite size can make them a good fit for the indoors.
 
Blue Elf Aloe (Aloe ‘Blue Elf’)
 
Blue aloe, like the name reveals, has a bluish-white pigment and stretches up to 24 inches wide. This type of aloe is native to South Africa and requires sufficient draining to grow strong. Salmon colored flowers bloom in late winter and spring months and attract hummingbirds. 
 
>>Aloe vera care tips
 
Light: Aloe vera plants need to be housed in a bright location with some direct sun in winter months. An odd fact about aloe vera is it can sunburn just like us. If you move an aloe vera into direct sunlight from a relatively shady location, the sun can do harm.
 
Water: Aloe vera plants are drought resistant, so they can survive with minimal watering. However, not watering your aloe vera plant will shorten its lifespan. An appropriate way to water an aloe vera plant is to water thoroughly and let the excess water drain. Then, water again when the top inch of soil is dry. This allows for optimal aloe vera growth. 
An indication that your aloe vera plant is not receiving enough water is brown leaf tips. However, a more common indication of improper watering is black spots on the leaves due to overwatering. Overwatering can be more dangerous than under watering because it could lead to root rot. 
 
Temperatures: The aloe vera plant can live in temperatures from 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. When growing aloe vera indoors, room temperatures of 60–75 degrees Fahrenheit are preferred for optimal plant growth.
 
Toxicity: Aloe plants are poisonous to dogs and cats. Common symptoms that indicate poisoning are vomiting, depression, anorexia and changes in urine color. The aloe vera plant carries anthraquinone glycosides which increase bowel movements commonly resulting in vomiting and diarrhea. 
Pests: Aloe can occasionally be infested with Aceria aloinis, commonly referred to as aloe mite. These mites are nearly invisible to the human eye. Under a microscope, people can identify this scheming mite as worm-like. 
Many aloe vera plant owners don’t recognize their plant has mites until damage is visible. Some indicators of aloe mites include warty growth on leaves and stems. Once infested with these lumps, they are nearly impossible to reverse. Complete removal of the plant is recommended to avoid further damage to other plants because these mites travel in the wind.
