>> Types of Pothos Plant

While you may find hybrids, there are only really two cultivars of Epipremnum aureum grown as houseplants. The most popular is aureum or golden pothos and marble queen is the second cultivar. 
1)Golden Pothos :As you may guess by its name, the leaves of golden pothos are variegated in golden-yellow. It is also referred to as devil’s ivy, centipede tongavine, or Solomon Islands’ Ivy. Golden pothos is native to the Solomon Islands and some parts of southeast Asia. Since pothos that grow in low light conditions tend to not feature the yellow variegation, you may wish to provide your golden pothos with one or two hours of moderate sunlight.

>>Pothos Plant Care Tips
Like all plants, it requires light, water, and proper air circulation to grow.
 
Light: While pothos do well in a variety of light conditions and can even tolerate low light, moderate indoor light is ideal. Outdoors they can be grown in shade to partial shade. Wherever you decide to display your pothos, just be sure to avoid direct sunlight. A highly variegated pothos may lose its variegation when placed in low-light conditions. Since only the green parts of the leaves can make energy, the leaves will compensate for the lack of light by turning greener. Pale leaves that turn yellowish in color could indicate that your plant is getting too much light.
 
Water: Keep soil moist, but be careful not to overwater. Pothos do best when their soil is allowed to dry out between waterings. To achieve this watering technique allow only the top two inches to dry being sure that the roots are still moist. If the leaves are wilting or turning brown, you should water the plant more often. If the leaves are yellow, you may be watering it too much. Excessive watering may cause root rot.
Do not allow your pothos to stand in water, unless it is a cutting started in water. Pothos can grow in water as well as soil, but they have a hard time switching from one growing medium to the other. A pothos plant started in soil will thrive best if continued to grow in soil, and vice versa.
 
Temperatures: Pothos can tolerate moderate temperatures ranging from 55 – 85℉, however they are tropical plants and so prefer high humidity and temperatures of 70 – 90℉.
 
Toxicity: Though rarely fatal, ingesting pothos can cause vomiting and irritation in pets and children due to the fact that it contains calcium oxalates. Pet owners should take extra caution when choosing greeney. 
Pests and Problems: The most common causes of problems with pothos are easy to fix, making it a great option for the first-time gardener. This houseplant has no serious insect or disease problems, although you might find mealy bugs and scale making a home out of your greenery. You can use a cotton ball dipped in alcohol to kill the pests. Checking the plant weekly can prevent high infestations. Even then, you can simply rinse off the mealy bugs or treat with a horticultural oil spray.
